# SOCIAL ANXIETY PROJECT

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
With over 5 million Kenyans struggling with anxiety disorders, MindGuard revolutionizes mental health through an intelligent early-warning system. Using Feedforward Neural Networks to interpret complex behavioral patterns, MindGuard detects anxiety risks and delivers personalized preventative interventions, helping individuals maintain optimal mental wellness before clinical intervention becomes necessary.


## OBJECTIVES
1. Can we create an intelligent early-warning system that accurately predicts who is likely to experience anxiety problems, allowing for timely prevention and support?

2. How can we provide personalized lifestyle recommendations that are most likely to help individuals reduce their anxiety risk based on their unique profile?

3. Which lifestyle factors have the biggest impact on anxiety and how can these insights guide effective prevention strategies and public health initiatives?
